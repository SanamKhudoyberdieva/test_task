####### Key Corrections Made:
1. **Consistent Markdown Formatting**: I fixed the indentation and ensured all code blocks are properly closed.
2. **Section Headings**: Adjusted heading levels for clarity and consistency.
3. **Code Block Structure**: Ensured all commands are clearly separated and easy to read.

With these adjustments, your README will be much clearer and more user-friendly!
